`jaxspec` is an X-ray spectral fitting library built in pure Python. It can currently load an X-ray spectrum (in the OGIP standard), define a spectral model from the implemented components, and calculate the best parameters using state-of-the-art Bayesian approaches. It is built on top of JAX to provide just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation of the spectral models, enabling the use of sampling algorithm such as NUTS.

`jaxspec` is written in pure Python, and has no dependancy to [HEASoft](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/), and can be installed directly using the `pip` command.

## Installation

We recommend the users to start from a fresh Python 3.10 [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). 

```
conda create -n jaxspec python=3.10
conda activate jaxspec
```

Once the environment is set up, you can install jaxspec directly from pypi

```
pip install jaxspec --upgrade
```
